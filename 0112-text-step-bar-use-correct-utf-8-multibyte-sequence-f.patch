For some reason in commit 113526408c5706c9efc7f43c3f8258354e762677
I commited the sequence \x25\x96\xa0 in place of the block character
that was there before.  I don't know where I got \x25 from, but it's
not right (and couldn't even be right since the high order bit isn't
set which is a requirement for the first byte in multi-byte utf-8
sequences).

This commit uses \xe2 instead which I got from doing:

$ echo ■  | xxd
0000000: e296 a00a                                ....
